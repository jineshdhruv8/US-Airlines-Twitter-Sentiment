@USAirways @shivadelrahim what about upgrades?
@USAirways how do you have only 1 flight into lexington this afternoon with the #1 @KentuckyMBB playing a big game tonight?  #DoBetter
@USAirways Flight 1815 (N747UW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @PHLAirport http://t.co/TtLwZgIyAg
@USAirways - what is your policy regarding large-size passengers who cannot fit into a single coach class seat?
@usairways Does anyone know the hold times for USAirways reservations?
@USAirways what's the point of email stating I didn't get bumped to 1st class? I know I'm not in first class- I booked the regular ticket
@USAirways we're glad to hear it. Out of curiosity- what causes such flight patterns?
@USAirways So no idea? Thanks...
@USAirways International
@USAirways landed at Phoenix- but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?
@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels- shuttles- re routing flights- delayed flights
@USAirways ah- and I was only given one shuttle voucher- so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill
@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?
@USAirways I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now?

@USAirways any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend?
@USAirways Yes- it was Sunday.
@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?

@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
@USAirways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online
@USAirways Yes- I get that. I’m asking: Specifically- what will you do with the feedback I’ve given you?
@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
@USAirways Thank you. But I don’t understand. What will you do with my feedback?

@USAirways I am following you now
@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
@USAirways but it's not their fault- because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat- 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?
@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0- vuelo24.es- vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning.
@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog- any updates
@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9- silicon valleys only 10 day film festival
@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
@USAirways How will I change it?
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag- why not let someone fly standby?
@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
@USAirways Only for one flight- though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03-  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte- then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way.
@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day
@USAirways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18
@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO 😂😂😂😂

@USAirways OK she is worried that something is wrong with the flight - #1870 - and should she consider flying earlier
@USAirways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.
@USAirways res went under her maiden name...married 50...no docs with maiden name.  Hence- problem.
@USAirways btw- not upset at usaiways- promise.
@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
@USAirways if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card- do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now
@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it
“@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM your confirmation code so we can forward your kind words.” sent

@USAirways really!??
@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?

@USAirways Looking forward to some friends and family time in Arizona.
@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?
@USAirways Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me- even if I am purchasing the tickets?
@USAirways how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ?
@usairways can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL.
@USAirways announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate- but it was a 'direct flight' #logic
@USAirways just realized my @AmericanAir advantage number wasn't used for my flight.  How do I get my ff miles?
@USAirways through- can you confirm that I haven't been charged?
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@USAirways No- this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?

@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76- I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?

@AmericanAir I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@AmericanAir @USAirways Yes- obviously! It just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7AM YESTERDAY.
@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
