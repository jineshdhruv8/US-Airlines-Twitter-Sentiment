@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.

@united it's amazing really.
@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago- but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.
@united Flew ORD to Miami and back and  had great crew- service on both legs. THANKS
